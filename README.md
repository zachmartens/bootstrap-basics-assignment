# Frameworks & Intro to JS Assignment:
Bootstrap Basics, Utilities, Forms, and Components

A demonstration of my comprehension around these subjects. Building a fully functional, responsive webpage using Bootstrap and some light CSS. I faced some challenges with stretching the banner image across the whole page, but solved it by pivoting to a larger secondary image. In the future I would like to impliment a sidebar Nav.


## Table of Contents

- Registration [#registration]
- Data Table [#data]
- Images [#images]
- Buttons [#buttons]
- Navbar [#navbar]
- Misc [#misc]

## Registration Form

- Includes fields for First & Last Name, Email, Password, and checkbox
- Checkbox: played around with a discovery, making it a toggle switch! I thought that was a nice touch
- Implimented Boostrap's grid layout to put first & last name side-by-side
- Validation classes for requiring Email & Password fields
- Submit button, styled with btn-success

## Table Data

- Implimented Bootstrap's table componenets to build
- Hard-code user data, simulating submissions
- Striped & Hover rows for better readability
- Table is responsive using 'table-responsive' div
- Bonus: brought back 'text-success' and 'text-muted' for a variation in simulation

## Images

- Responsive images using img-fluid class
- Fluid container implimented to stretch img across the page
- Circular images below banner
- Bonus: some extra photos, tying in the table data in a fun and playful way

## Buttons

- One button visible on all screen sizes
- One button hides on small screens, using responsive display utilities (d-none and d-md-block)

## Navbar

- Created navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections
- Linked to sections in assignment that most aligned with the above links
- Navbar collapses into hamburger menu on smaller screens
- Implimented Boostrap utilities to style the navbar

## Misc

- Implimented light CSS to elevate readability slightly

## Lessons Learned

I learned very quickly how useful and efficient Bootstrap can be! Gained knowlege and ease around working with <div>s. While at this stage, I am often referencing notes and cheat sheets for reminders of what options I have around Bootstrap Utilities, my efficiency grew quickly and I feel confident that things are settling into my mind around the subject. Looking forward to learning more!
